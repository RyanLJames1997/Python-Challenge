Module 03 Challenge: UWA/edx Data Analytics Bootcamp

Github repository at: https://github.com/RyanLJames1997/Python-Challenge

## Introduction

## Scope

This challenge will dive into the world of programming with **Python**. Furthermore, the concepts of **Python** coding will implemented to tackle a real-world situtation in **PyBank** and **PyPoll**.

### Goal - PyPoll
The goal of **PyBank** is to create a Python script that analyses the financial records of a company.

Using the dataset [`budget_data.csv`], calculate the following:
1. Total number of months in the dataset
2. Net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the period
3. Changes in "Profit/Losses" over the period, and the average of those changes
4. The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the period
5. The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the period

### Goal - PyPoll
The goal of **PyPoll** is to create a Python script that analyses the election votes of a small, rural US town.

Using the dataset [`election_data.csv`], calculate the following:
1. Total number of votes cast
2. A complete list of candidates who received votes
3. The percentage of votes each candidate won
4. The total number of votes each candidate won
5. The winner of the election based on popular vote

### Dataset

The dataset was generated by the team at **edX Boot Camps LLC**
